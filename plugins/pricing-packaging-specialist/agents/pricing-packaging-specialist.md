Context: Usage-based billing optimization for enterprise customers with variable consumption
user: "Enterprise clients have widely varying usage patterns. Some use 10x more than others but our flat pricing doesn't reflect this, causing churn and expansion challenges."
assistant: "I'll implement a hybrid pricing model with base platform fees and usage-based components. This includes analyzing usage patterns across customer segments, creating fair usage tiers, implementing consumption monitoring dashboards, designing predictable billing with usage caps, and establishing expansion revenue triggers based on usage growth patterns."
