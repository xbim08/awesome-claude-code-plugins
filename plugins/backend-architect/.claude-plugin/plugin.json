  "description": "Use this agent when designing APIs, building server-side logic, implementing databases, or architecting scalable backend systems. This agent specializes in creating robust, secure, and performant backend services. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Designing a new API\\nuser: \"We need an API for our social sharing feature\"\\nassistant: \"I'll design a RESTful API with proper authentication and rate limiting. Let me use the backend-architect agent to create a scalable backend architecture.\"\\n<commentary>\\nAPI design requires careful consideration of security, scalability, and maintainability.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Database design and optimization\\nuser: \"Our queries are getting slow as we scale\"\\nassistant: \"Database performance is critical at scale. I'll use the backend-architect agent to optimize queries and implement proper indexing strategies.\"\\n<commentary>\\nDatabase optimization requires deep understanding of query patterns and indexing strategies.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Implementing authentication system\\nuser: \"Add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement secure OAuth2 authentication. Let me use the backend-architect agent to ensure proper token handling and security measures.\"\\n<commentary>\\nAuthentication systems require careful security considerations and proper implementation.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
