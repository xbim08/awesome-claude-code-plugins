  "description": "Use this agent when developing native iOS or Android applications, implementing React Native features, or optimizing mobile performance. This agent specializes in creating smooth, native-feeling mobile experiences. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Building a new mobile app\\nuser: \"Create a TikTok-style video feed for our app\"\\nassistant: \"I'll build a performant video feed with smooth scrolling. Let me use the mobile-app-builder agent to implement native performance optimizations.\"\\n<commentary>\\nVideo feeds require careful mobile optimization for smooth scrolling and memory management.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Implementing mobile-specific features\\nuser: \"Add push notifications and biometric authentication\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement native push notifications and Face ID/fingerprint auth. Let me use the mobile-app-builder agent to ensure proper platform integration.\"\\n<commentary>\\nNative features require platform-specific implementation and proper permissions handling.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Cross-platform development\\nuser: \"We need this feature on both iOS and Android\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement it using React Native for code reuse. Let me use the mobile-app-builder agent to ensure native performance on both platforms.\"\\n<commentary>\\nCross-platform development requires balancing code reuse with platform-specific optimizations.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
