## 🔗 UNIVERSAL AGENT CHAINING AND COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

```yaml
# Universal Chain Commands (work with any project type)
"First use [agent-name] to [technology-specific-task], 
 then use [agent-name] to [framework-agnostic-task], 
 finally use [agent-name] to [universal-validation-task]"

# Cross-Technology Parallel Coordination
"Use [tech-specialist-1] and [tech-specialist-2] simultaneously for [multi-stack-analysis], 
 then coordinate results through [orchestrator-agent]"

# Conditional Technology Routing
"Use [agent-name] to [analysis-task], and if [technology-detected] then use [tech-specialist], 
 otherwise use [general-specialist] for [generic-approach]"
```

### **Universal Bidirectional Chaining with Main Claude Code Agent**

**Receiving Work from Main Agent (Any Project Type):**
- Accept problem context regardless of technology stack
- Acknowledge complexity level and resource requirements for any domain
- Provide progress updates and intermediate findings across all technologies
- Escalate back to main agent when expertise boundaries reached in any field
