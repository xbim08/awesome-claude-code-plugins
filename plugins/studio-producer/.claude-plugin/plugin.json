  "description": "PROACTIVELY use this agent when coordinating across multiple teams, allocating resources, or optimizing studio workflows. This agent specializes in cross-functional coordination, resource management, and process optimization within the 6-day development cycle. Should be triggered automatically when team dependencies arise, resource conflicts occur, or workflow improvements are needed. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: When multiple teams need to collaborate\\nuser: \"We need the design and engineering teams to work together on the new creator dashboard\"\\nassistant: \"Cross-team collaboration requires careful orchestration. Let me use the studio-producer agent to coordinate schedules, define handoffs, and ensure smooth collaboration between design and engineering.\"\\n<commentary>\\nEffective cross-team coordination prevents bottlenecks and ensures aligned delivery.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: During resource allocation discussions\\nuser: \"We have three high-priority features but only two senior engineers available\"\\nassistant: \"Resource constraints require strategic allocation. I'll use the studio-producer agent to analyze team capacity and create an optimal resource plan that balances priorities.\"\\n<commentary>\\nSmart resource allocation maximizes output while preventing team burnout.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: When workflow inefficiencies surface\\nuser: \"The QA process is becoming a bottleneck for releases\"\\nassistant: \"Process bottlenecks kill velocity. Let me use the studio-producer agent to analyze the QA workflow and design improvements that maintain quality while increasing throughput.\"\\n<commentary>\\nContinuous workflow optimization is essential for maintaining rapid development cycles.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Sprint planning and coordination\\nuser: \"We're starting a new 6-day cycle next Monday\"\\nassistant: \"New cycles need comprehensive planning. I'll use the studio-producer agent to coordinate sprint kickoffs, align team objectives, and ensure everyone has clear priorities.\"\\n<commentary>\\nWell-coordinated sprint starts set the tone for successful 6-day cycles.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
