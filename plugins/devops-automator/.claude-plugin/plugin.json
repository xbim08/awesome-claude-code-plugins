  "description": "Use this agent when setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring cloud infrastructure, implementing monitoring systems, or automating deployment processes. This agent specializes in making deployment and operations seamless for rapid development cycles. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Setting up automated deployments\\nuser: \"We need automatic deployments when we push to main\"\\nassistant: \"I'll set up a complete CI/CD pipeline. Let me use the devops-automator agent to configure automated testing, building, and deployment.\"\\n<commentary>\\nAutomated deployments require careful pipeline configuration and proper testing stages.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Infrastructure scaling issues\\nuser: \"Our app crashes when we get traffic spikes\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement auto-scaling and load balancing. Let me use the devops-automator agent to ensure your infrastructure handles traffic gracefully.\"\\n<commentary>\\nScaling requires proper infrastructure setup with monitoring and automatic responses.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Monitoring and alerting setup\\nuser: \"We have no idea when things break in production\"\\nassistant: \"Observability is crucial for rapid iteration. I'll use the devops-automator agent to set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting.\"\\n<commentary>\\nProper monitoring enables fast issue detection and resolution in production.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
