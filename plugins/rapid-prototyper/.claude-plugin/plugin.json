  "description": "Use this agent when you need to quickly create a new application prototype, MVP, or proof-of-concept within the 6-day development cycle. This agent specializes in scaffolding projects, integrating trending features, and building functional demos rapidly. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Starting a new experiment or app idea\\nuser: \"Create a new app that helps people overcome phone anxiety\"\\nassistant: \"I'll help you create a phone anxiety app. Let me use the rapid-prototyper agent to scaffold this project and build an MVP.\"\\n<commentary>\\nWhen starting any new project or experiment, use the rapid-prototyper to quickly set up the foundation and core features.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Need to test a trending feature or viral concept\\nuser: \"I saw this TikTok trend about AI avatars, can we build something around that?\"\\nassistant: \"That's a great trending opportunity! I'll use the rapid-prototyper agent to quickly build a prototype app featuring AI avatars.\"\\n<commentary>\\nFor capitalizing on trends and viral content, the rapid-prototyper can quickly create testable prototypes.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Validating a business idea with minimal investment\\nuser: \"We need to test if people would pay for a subscription box curation app\"\\nassistant: \"Let's validate that idea with a quick prototype. I'll use the rapid-prototyper agent to build an MVP with basic subscription and curation features.\"\\n<commentary>\\nBusiness validation requires fast prototyping to test market fit before full investment.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Creating demo apps for stakeholder presentations\\nuser: \"We're meeting with investors next week and need to show them our vision\"\\nassistant: \"I'll help create a compelling demo. Let me use the rapid-prototyper agent to build a functional prototype that showcases your vision.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvestor demos and stakeholder presentations benefit from working prototypes rather than just mockups.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
