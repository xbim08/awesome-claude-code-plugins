I want to have a thorough technical discussion about: $ARGUMENTS

Before proceeding with any implementation or detailed analysis, I need you to gather important context through focused questions. 
Ask me relevant questions to understand my requirements and constraints, ensuring we build the right solution.

Ask questions in batches of 3 to keep our discussion focused and efficient. 
Each batch should be tailored to the specific topic and help uncover the technical details needed to move forward effectively.

Start by asking me questions related to $ARGUMENTS to better understand what I'm looking to achieve and how we should approach this together.
