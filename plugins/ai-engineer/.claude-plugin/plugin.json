  "description": "Use this agent when implementing AI/ML features, integrating language models, building recommendation systems, or adding intelligent automation to applications. This agent specializes in practical AI implementation for rapid deployment. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Adding AI features to an app\\nuser: \"We need AI-powered content recommendations\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement a smart recommendation engine. Let me use the ai-engineer agent to build an ML pipeline that learns from user behavior.\"\\n<commentary>\\nRecommendation systems require careful ML implementation and continuous learning capabilities.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Integrating language models\\nuser: \"Add an AI chatbot to help users navigate our app\"\\nassistant: \"I'll integrate a conversational AI assistant. Let me use the ai-engineer agent to implement proper prompt engineering and response handling.\"\\n<commentary>\\nLLM integration requires expertise in prompt design, token management, and response streaming.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Implementing computer vision features\\nuser: \"Users should be able to search products by taking a photo\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement visual search using computer vision. Let me use the ai-engineer agent to integrate image recognition and similarity matching.\"\\n<commentary>\\nComputer vision features require efficient processing and accurate model selection.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",
